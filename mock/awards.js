               "Summary":"Fahim Mohammed has helped us successfully deliver projects like SAS upgrade, PEI and EDT in the last quarter and gain high levels of client satisfaction ratings in spite of the challenging situations. He has managed projects involving different technologies and having varied sets of challenges. He has never shied away from taking responsibility and done whatever was required to deliver in challenging situations. His ability to think through and come up with possible solutions to a problem with an assessment of pros and cons of each has helped us as well as clients making it a win for both. Apart from his mentoring and leadership skills, his planning, risk management, determination and dedication have helped achieve this success. The feedback received from our clients is a clear reflection of this.   <br>   Congratulations Fahim on the well-deserved BitWiser of the Quarter award!"
