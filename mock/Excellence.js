They quickly came up to speed and during the course of project, client team changed their design and approach several times resulting in a lot of extra work at our end without any change in the delivery timeline. Team had to co-ordinate with Client VP, Client architects and QA team multiple times in a day for technical discussions and release plans. In addition there were lot of environment issues which affected the work. Team self-organized themselves, prioritized work on the go, suggested alternative approaches and did smart work to meet the timelines. Team worked efficiently and overcame all challenges with their excellent technical skills and exceptional team work. Honey and Snehal lead the team very efficiently making sure all daily timelines were met. Team's hard work was also greatly appreciated by Mark (VP) and Andra (SVP) also during her offshore visit.</span></div>\n<div style=\"margin&#58;0in 0in 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size&#58;11pt;font-family&#58;calibri, sans-serif;\">&#160;</span></div>\n<div style=\"margin&#58;0in 0in 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size&#58;11pt;font-family&#58;calibri, sans-serif;\">Congratulations to all of you on a well-deserved award.
